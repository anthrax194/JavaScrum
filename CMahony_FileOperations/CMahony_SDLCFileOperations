		a.	The View and Control are combined into the FileModRunner class
		b.	The Model is the FileModifier class
		c.	The two classes have been abstracted from eachother, any other class can still call operations on the File Modifier class, perhaps for a dump of a lot of data into the file instead 
			of simply a program that allows someone to input into the file.
